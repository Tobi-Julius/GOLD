                <p>An old man lived in the Village.He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world.The
                    whole village was tired of him;he was always gloomy,he constantly complained and was always in bad mood.
                </p><br>
                <p>The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonus were his words.People avoided
                    him, because his misfortune became contagious.It was even unnatural and insulting to be  happy next to him.
                </p><br>
                <p>He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.</p><br>
                <p>But one day,when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened.Instantly everyone started
                    hearing the rumour: <br></p><br>
                <p><q><em> An Old Man is Happy today,he doesn't complain about anything,smiles, and even his face is
                        freshened up.</em></q></p><br>
                <p>The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:</p>
               <p> <b>Villager:</b>what happened to you?</p><br>
               <p><q><em>Nothing special. Eighty years I've been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then i decided to live
                   without happiness and just enjoy life. That's why I'm happy now.</em></q>An Old Man</p><br>
                   <p><b>Moral of the story:</b></p><br>
                   <p>Don't chase happiness. Enjoy your life</p><br>
